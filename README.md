# Go-Fish
Go Fish is a mobile game based on the classic card game of the same name!

This is a school project where the goal is to build a mobile game, and connect it to a database (Firebase in this case).

I'm making the game mainly for android because of compatibility with Windows and Unity, but if there is time it would be nice to make an iOS version.
